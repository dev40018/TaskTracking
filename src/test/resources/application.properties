# DB_CLOSE_DELAY in H2 database is a connection setting that controls how long the database stays open after all connections have been closed. By default, an in-memory database is closed immediately when the last connection is closed. Setting DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1 keeps the database\
# open until the JVM shuts down,  while positive values specify the delay in seconds.
